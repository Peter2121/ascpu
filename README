Description:
============

This is an AfterStep look & feel CPU statistics monitor tool
for computers running Linux, FreeBSD, HP-UX or AIX.

I just got fed up once that all the AfterStep applets are
so unconfigurable and decided to write my own so that I have
the different look the way I want it :) The first to go
was asload as the simplest. Now it does not contain any
code (I think so) from asload and is written from scratch by
truly yours.

What you see on the display:
	The right (big) area displays the current load on
	the CPU or rather the load on the CPU during the
	last update period. Default update period is 1 sec
	but you can change that. The load is divided into
	three parts: system CPU time (bright), nice CPU
	time (medium), and the user CPU time (dark).
	The consumed CPU time is displayed in percents of
	total (plus idle time that is) CPU time passed.

	On the left side you have an indicator that shows
	the same values taken average over a number of samples.
	The default number of samples is 60. This means
	with the default setting of update rate once a second
	you see the average CPU load during the last minute.

Ok, you see, Cory Visi got me into this mess so it is not
my fault. Anyways, what you just read above is ok, though
you can use this thing "the other way around". That is, you
can give a small number of samples to the "average indicator"
and a big number of samples to the "running history window".
In that case the average value will be updated more often
than the running history. For example, if you take a value
of 1 for the number of samples for the average it will show
you the actual load on the CPU at this moment. And you can
at the same time give the value of, let's say, 60 to the
running history window. Then the running history will actually
show you average loads over 1 minute periods.

So, there are two exactly opposite ways of running the widget.
But I am glad to have implemented them :)

A nice idea of having the ascpu work in a completely
different way from what I thought was appropriate comes
from Cory Visi <visi@cmu.edu>.

ascpu contains some code from asapm utility. Do I have to
give credit to myself? :-) There is some stuff for working 
with X windows that I inherited from asapm tool and that
initially comes from some place else. See asapm for credits too.
